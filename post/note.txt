The posts.md is a widge file. This file should be moved to /content/home when I need to add a recent posts section in the homepage. 
Details to add recent posts section:
1) move posts.md from /content/post to /content/home
2) creat newpost.md in /content/post
3) add the associated [[menu.main]] entry of post in config.toml.
