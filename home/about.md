# About me

I am a postdoctoral research associate in [Dr. Jack Dekkers' lab](https://www.ans.iastate.edu/people/jack-c-dekkers) in the Department of Animal Science at Iowa State University. My research at Iowa focuses on the integration of biological and whole-genome prediction models. My Ph.D. research in [Dr. Gota Morotaâ€™s lab](http://morotalab.org/) at Virginia Tech centered on designing and modeling high-throughput phenotyping data in quantitative genetics and image analysis in computer vision. My overarching research interest is to understand the genotype-phenotype map in animals and plants using computational and statistical genetics. Particularly, I am interested in developing and applying statistical methods to the whole-genome prediction of complex traits, genome-wide association analysis, high-throughput phenotyping data analysis, and image analysis.
